        <p>Depressive disorders, including Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD), are serious mental health conditions that affect mood, behavior, and overall well-being. Here's a brief overview of each:</p>

        <h2>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</h2>
        <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities, fatigue, changes in appetite or weight, sleep disturbances, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, difficulty concentrating, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide.</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Symptoms must be present for at least two weeks for a diagnosis.</p>
        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> MDD can significantly impair daily functioning, affecting work, school, and social relationships.</p>

        <h2>Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD)</h2>
        <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Chronic low mood, feelings of hopelessness, low self-esteem, poor appetite or overeating, sleep disturbances, low energy, difficulty concentrating, and irritability (especially in children and adolescents).</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Symptoms must persist for at least two years for adults (one year for children and adolescents).</p>
        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> PDD can cause long-term difficulties in fulfilling responsibilities at work, school, and home, and can interfere with social interactions.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Therapy:</strong> Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and other forms of talk therapy can be effective.</li>
            <li><strong>Medications:</strong> Antidepressants and other medications can help manage symptoms.</li>
            <li><strong>Lifestyle Changes:</strong> Regular exercise, healthy diet, and relaxation techniques like meditation can be beneficial.</li>
            <li><strong>Support Groups:</strong> Connecting with others facing similar challenges can provide emotional support.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Both MDD and PDD are treatable, and many people find relief through a combination of therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes. If you or someone you know is struggling with depression, reaching out to a mental health professional can be a crucial first step.</p>
